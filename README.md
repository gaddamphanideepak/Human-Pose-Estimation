# Human-Pose-Estimation
## 1.Introduction 
In this project we present our approach to human pose estimation using a machine learning model trained on a dataset comprising 5081 images annotated with landmarks describing human poses.
## 2.Dataset
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oF1OB3Fgd-9MVarUTB4sJYMg1alPZWpt?usp=drive_link 
This dataset should be added to the shortcut in google drive

## 3.Why this Dataset? 
This dataset consists of 5081 high quality images. 
It also uses annotations from json files to access the images. 

## 4.How to Use?
There are two google colab files in the Github 
Human_Pose_Detection_Resnet.ipynb
Human_Pose_Detection.ipynb
Each of the notebook files must be open using google colab and they should be run independently after adding the shortcut of provided dataset in the google drive

## 5.Results
We can find the Batch Loss and MSE Loss in the notebooks. 
This helps us to understand differences between Resnet and PoseDetector Model.
